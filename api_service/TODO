* Create new dockerfile for workers and remove R from API server container
* Maybe we can link in the R Portion of Worker Containers - IE

-----------------      --------------------  
|  worker       |      | Model X          |
|        /RLib--|------| /usr/bin/lib/R   |
|               |      |                  |
|               |      |                  |
-----------------      --------------------

This would give us more independence from model and their requirements.
The only complication are the external libraries(gdal, etc).
